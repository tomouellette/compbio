# Computational biology

This repository aims to be a compilation of various naive implementations of computational biology methods.

## Table of contents

| File	| Description | 
| ------ | ---------- |
| horizontal_gene_transfer_detection | Functions for analyzing nucleotide frequency correlations across genes with the purpose of detecting horizontal gene transfer. A sample gene set is provided. Based off Tamames and Moya (2008). |
| isotopic_peaks | Generates tables and plots theoretical MS2 spectra of y-ions and b-ions for any given peptide sequence. Additional option to plot predicted post-translational modification shifts for crotonylation. | 
| smith_waterman | Implementation Smith-Waterman algorithm with recursive traceback designed for RNA hybridization. Finds all equal scoring local alignment and traces all possible paths. Returns all possible alignments along with alignment scores. |
