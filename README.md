# Computational biology

This repository aims to be a compilation of various naive implementations of computational biology methods.

## Table of contents

| File	| Description | 
| ----- | ----------- |
| horizontalGeneTransferDetection | Functions for analyzing nucleotide frequency correlations across genes with the purpose of detecting horizontal gene transfer. A sample gene set is provided. Based off Tamames and Moya (2008). |
| cpgPlots | Identify and plot CpG islands in nucleotide sequences (based off of EMBOSS Cpgplot) [Under construction] |
| isotopicPeaks | Generates theoretical MS2 spectra of y-ions and b-ions for any given peptide sequence. Has additional option to plot predicted post-translational modification shifts for crotonylation. |
